# This is not a universal Exel to CSV Converter!

This was created for a very specific use case and although the codebase might be useful to you, there won't be any merit in using the current release.

This Converter reads an .xlsx file using Apache Poi and puts it into a twodimensional arraylist.
Finally the desired information is put into a  CSV file.
